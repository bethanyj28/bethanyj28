## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
* I struggle with anxiety, especially social anxiety. I've been going to therapy and recently started meds which has helped a lot!
* I'm an over/under thinker. My brain takes up a lot of energy overthinking things to the point that I underthink other things. A lot of this stems from my anxiety, but it is something I'm working on.
* I am extremely jazzed that I get to do software engineering for a living. I found out that I love to code through a series of events in college and for a while was discouraged that I wouldn't be able to wedge myself into this industry without a degree in CS. I still get excited telling people I'm a software engineer even if they don't find it as interesting as I do!
* Go is my favorite programming language ❤️
	
### What drives you nuts?
* Process for the sake of process.
* Unwillingness to learn or put effort into understanding something.
* Requesting Changes on a PR without specific criteria for what should change.
* Dichotomous reasoning.
* Putting down others chosen tooling/processes.

### What are your quirks?
* When making decisions, I love a good pros/cons list (or in more technical contexts, an ADR). This helps me visualize the options better and forces me to think about things I might've not considered previously.
* I'm from North Carolina but both sides of my family are midwestern, which is definitely reflected in my personality.
* I use exclamations a lot! Sorry!! (I also apologize a lot!)
		
### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
* People think I'm judgemental since I tend to be on the quieter side in large group settings. I actually think I'm a fairly empathetic person, but get embarrassed when people assume they know what I'm thinking. I just usually take time to think on things which makes group conversations tougher.
* People tend to assume I'm very young and inexperienced. I would prefer if people gave me the benefit of the doubt first.
* I think people assume I'm sensitive and don't default to giving me feedback. I very much thrive on feedback and would like to think I can reflect on it without being offended.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
* Fun! I love when we can have fun and laugh together.
* Curiosity and challenging assumptions. I appreciate different perspectives and insights into problems!
* Empathy. I think being able to empathize with other viewpoints and perspectives that aren't your own is so important for working with others.
* Trust. I align a lot with the value of "trust by default", I believe that the majority of people are trying the best with what their current situation allows.
* Collaboration. A willingness to work together in whatever form (pairing, discussion, questions) makes everything better.
* Inclusion and ensuring access to information that might help others do their job better.
* Promoting an environment of psychological safety.

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
* Gatekeep opportunities and information.
* Roast code. While at the end of the day code is cheap and easy to change, there is a human that wrote it and better ways to deliver feedback.
* "Got a second?" or dropping a Zoom link with no context.
	
### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
* Come to book club and learn together!
* Coach me by letting me think through a problem and attempt to get experience solving it rather than just giving me the answer.
* Let their personalities shine through their work and interactions.
* Encourage work-life balance and model healthy behavior.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
* I was a [Supplemental Instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplemental_instruction) leader in college and that experience has heavily influenced my approach to mentorship and collaboration. I believe the best way to teach is by providing an environment that faciliates learning and growth in a collaborative manner.
* For example, when a mentee asks me a question I will either give enough information to help them get unstuck or coach them through searching for the answer. If there are multiple people I'm coaching, I like to redirect and see if anyone else knows the answer to give them experience answering questions.
	
### What’s the best way to communicate with you?
* I prefer less rigid communication structures like Slack that enable async conversation to happen in a more natural form.
* I like Zoom/video calls to get face-to-face time, but as an introvert I have a limit to how much I can do.
* I do keep tabs on my email, but I'll always default to Slack.
	
### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
* I very much subscribe to the opinion of "Strong opinions, loosely held". I believe there's usually more than one correct way to do something. My experiences have informed my perspective but I don't think that invalidates other perspectives.
* I think context matters with this as well. If we are in the planning phase of something I am very open to any and all thoughts and ideas for the direction and shape of the work. However, if I'm trying to execute on something, I prefer to keep the scope as minimal as possible (it doesn't mean I'm completely unwilling, just understand it might not be a now thing).
* Data and concrete examples are always helpful. I think it's important to fully understand the "why" behind any ask.
* To be honest I love sparkles ✨ Not so much for the points (though I do love some fake internet points!) but more because it gives me something to look back on when doing reflections!
	 
### How do you like to give feedback?
* If it's something I feel emotional about, I like to take at least a day to make sure that there is no emotion associated with my feedback and that it is as constructive to the person's growth as possible.
* I feel very strongly about approaching feedback with empathy and trying to put myself in someone else's shoes first. I think there's typically a reason someone does something and usually they're trying their best.
* I prefer to give feedback async and discuss sync if necessary, but also will always try to keep preferences in mind.

### How do you like to get feedback?
* I thrive on feedback. I don't have a big preference on format, whether it's a discussion, PR, Slack, 1:1, etc. I do prefer it to be as immediate as possible. That doesn't necessarily mean right away (as I don't like to give feedback right away), just that I don't enjoy learning feedback during bi-annual reviews when something could've been worked on a lot sooner.
* I think empathy is the biggest thing I appreciate for feedback. Trust that I'm doing my best and have a desire to learn and grow!
* I prefer feedback to be constructive, but I also don't think this is something to agonize over. I thought The Software Engineer's Guidebook phrased this well:
  > Feedback is a gift, both when given and received. Poorly delivered feedback is also a gift, but some work is needed to turn it into something useful you can act on!
