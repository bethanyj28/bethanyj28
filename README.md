### Hello!

My name is __Bethany__<sup>_she/her_</sup> and I'm a software engineer in the beautiful Charlotte, NC!

My day-to-day job involves writing __go__ and __AWS__ infrastructure at [Red Ventures](https://www.redventures.com/). I've used a lot of that knowledge in my personal projects, like [Gomato](https://github.com/bethanyj28/gomato). 
Writing in go helped me see the beauty of simplicity within an API, something which I try to apply to all code that I write.

Lately I've been using __python__ a lot to prototype ideas and learn about working with data. Data science and machine learning are two fields that have always interested me, but I had never used python for projects in the classes I took. I'm really loving how _easy_ it is to do anything in python, which makes it a really fun language to write! Most recently, I've used my python knowledge to create [transcription-api](https://github.com/bethanyj28/transcription-api), a image text transcriber!

I'm also currently reading up on __react__ so that I can build a personal site and attempt to freelance. It's definitely different from most things that I've done, but it's really cool to learn about the other side of the coin so that I can work better with my front end colleagues. 

I spend most of my free time working on various passion projects, but would love to start contributing to open source and giving back. When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to podcasts about coding, hiking, kayaking, lifting heavy things, baking, playing piano, singing, reading, and dogspotting.
